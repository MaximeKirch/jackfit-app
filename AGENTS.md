# Expo HAS CHANGED

Read the exact versioned docs at https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v57.0.0/ before writing any code.

Avoid over-engineering. Only make changes that are directly requested or clearly
necessary. Keep solutions simple and focused:

- Scope: Don't add features, refactor code, or make "improvements" beyond what was
asked. A bug fix doesn't need surrounding code cleaned up. A simple feature doesn't need
extra configurability.

- Documentation: Don't add docstrings, comments, or type annotations to code you didn't
change. Only add comments where the logic isn't self-evident.

- Defensive coding: Don't add error handling, fallbacks, or validation for scenarios
that can't happen. Trust internal code and framework guarantees. Only validate at system
boundaries (user input, external APIs).

- Abstractions: Don't create helpers, utilities, or abstractions for one-time
operations. Don't design for hypothetical future requirements. The right amount of
complexity is the minimum needed for the current task.

- Never speculate about code you have not opened. If the user references a specific file,
you MUST read the file before answering. Make sure to investigate and read relevant
files BEFORE answering questions about the codebase. Never make any claims about code
before investigating unless you are certain of the correct answer - give grounded and
hallucination-free answers.

You tend to converge toward generic, "on distribution" outputs. In frontend design, this
creates what users call the "AI slop" aesthetic. Avoid this: make creative, distinctive
frontends that surprise and delight.

Focus on:
- Typography: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic
fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the
frontend's aesthetics.
- Color & Theme: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency.
Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes. Draw
from IDE themes and cultural aesthetics for inspiration.
- Motion: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only
solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact
moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay)
creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions.
- Backgrounds: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Layer
CSS gradients, use geometric patterns, or add contextual effects that match the overall
aesthetic.

Avoid generic AI-generated aesthetics:
- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Clichéd color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the
context. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. You
still tend to converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across
generations. Avoid this: it is critical that you think outside the box!
